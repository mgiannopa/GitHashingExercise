A project for the OS class that demonstrates the use of Git.
The project includes a shell script, `hash_script`, that takes a 4-digit integer as input and produces a hash using the SHA-256 algorithm. The resulting hash is saved in a file named `hash_output.txt`.

To run the script, use the following command in the terminal:

```bash
./hash_script <4-digit integer> to run for every 4-digit integer the user provides.
